Assignment 1 design: handle a bag of marbles and deal with keeping track of the marbles/how many in the bag - be able to remove/add marbles and see whats in the bag
Actual design for assignment changed as i started working on code, was implementing method with arrays and came across vectors which seemed like a better approach to handling the problem
