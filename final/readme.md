Design: To create a graph data structure that has the ability to add new vertexs/nodes as well as adding new edges between them, it also needs to have a function that will figure out the shortest path between two nodes and a minimum spanning tree algorithm function.

I used Dijikstras algorithm for the shorest path function, and kruskals algorithm for the minimum spanning tree function.
