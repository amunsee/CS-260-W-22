Assignment 2 Design:

2.
	1. Functions we are likely to need for a queue: 
	
		-get size function
		-find starting point/point to starting point
		-find end point/point to end point

	2. Values we will need to know for the queue to function properly: 
	
		-Values we need to know about a queue would be the starting point, end point, location of one list item to another, and how many items are between the start and end (the size of the queue).
 
3.
	1. Functions we will likely need for a list to function like this:
		
		(might be overthinking how much needs to go into this)
		-go to start of list
		-go to end of list
		-get size of list
		-add new list item to end
		-add new list itme at specific location
		-list initialization/creation
		-remove item from end of list
		-remove item from specicic location
		-print list items
		-get value of list item at location

	2. Values we will need to know about the structure for our list to function properly:
	
		-Current position in the list for inserting and looking at nodes
		-Where the start of the list is
		-where the end of the list is
		-the size of the list, so we dont try to go past the end
